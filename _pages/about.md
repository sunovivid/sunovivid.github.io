I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Professor Alexei Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/). My research interests include artificial intelligence, computer vision, generative models, and diffusion models. I am particularly fascinated by the fundamental principles underlying how the world works and by incorporating inductive biases derived from these principles into generative models. I am also interested in generating images, videos, and 3D models for both artistic and practical purposes.

Before starting my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, I was a research intern at [CVLAB](https://cvlab.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, where I co-authored [Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG)](https://ku-cvlab.github.io/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance/), one of the earliest works on improving the sample quality of diffusion models by guiding them away from perturbed models. If you are interested, please see my publications below.

In my free time, I enjoy drawing, listening to music, playing the piano, cycling, and exploring new places. If you have any questions or would like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out via email (suno.vivid@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donghoon-ahn-622290246), or send me a direct message on [X](https://x.com/donghoon_ahn). I welcome your messages.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
